Overview

I created a basic grocery list program where the user can add an item, change an items price or quantity, delete an item, and finish the program.

I wrote this program to make it easier to compile and calculate the price of a grocery list. That way i don't have to do the math myself.

# Development Environment

I used visual studio code to write the program, test it, edit it, and debug the program.

I used python for the programming language

# Future Work

* First thing i would probably want to work on for this program is have the program remember a list and allow you to pull a remembered list back. This way i have memorized grocery lists.
* Next, after making it remember certain lists, i would alter the program so that i can alter a remembered list, whether thats adding a new item, editing an old item, or deleting an item.
